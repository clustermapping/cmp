Clusters emerge organically from market processes because they raise a company\'s productivity and competitiveness, which are influenced by local assets and the presence of like firms, institutions, and infrastructure that surround it. Examples of prominent clusters include: the entertainment clusters in Hollywood and Las Vegas, the tech hub of Silicon Valley, financial services in New York City, and North Carolina\'s Research Triangle.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n<h2>Why Map Clusters?<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The United States needs new tools and collaborative mechanisms to boost its competitiveness and achieve sustainable job growth. While some determinants of competitiveness are national in scope or the result of national policies, most of the critical drivers of competitiveness are regional and local, not national.<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nThe presence of clusters, and influential indicactors such as specialized skills, infrastructure, and technology, vary markedly across regions. This tends to result in substantial differences in prosperity among the states and regions within a nation. As research over the last decade has shown, clusters are a prominent feature of all successful and growing economies, and a crucial force for competitiveness, entrepreneurship, and new business growth. Thus, cluster-based economic strategies pose an important agenda for economic policy and existing macroeconomic efforts.<br \\/>\\r\\n<br \\/>\\r\\nFor any region in the U.S., this website can compare overall economic performance to other regions, identify the most important clusters in the economy, and measure their relative performance over time. The cluster mapping data provides a way to understand the underlying drivers of a region\'s unique mix of jobs, relative wages, employment growth, formation of new firms, and patenting performance. Defining clusters using consistent, evidence-based statistical methods, and comparing cluster competitiveness across regions, allow for a more detailed understanding of the composition and competitive position of regional economies, and in turn, that of the nation.<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/div>\\r\\n","format":"filtered_html","weight":"0","vocabulary_machine_name":"section","metatags":[],"path":{"pathauto":"0"}}}';
