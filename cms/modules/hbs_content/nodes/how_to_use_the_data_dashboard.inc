This allows users to discover information of interest then review and examine supporting data, when available. The Data Dashboard allows you to access all the available data on different regions and unique clusters in one place. Here you can perform deeper analyses, focusing on any particular region or a particular cluster of interest.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Getting Started<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Data Dashboard provides you two options for drawing analysis from the available data; you can either view cluster data on the map or in charts. To start, select the appropriate option from the upper left hand corner of the data dashboard. This panel is where you will make all selections in manipulating the data that is displayed.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Once you have chosen whether you want to see maps or charts, you will be asked what type of data you want to focus on. The choices available are either regional data or cluster specific data. In this way you can focus on a specific region, or you can focus on a specific cluster across all regions. Because the map shows regional data, the map will default to cluster specific data.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Available Analysis<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You will next be given the option to access available analysis. These charts provide you with some of the most useful or sought after information and charts from the U.S. Cluster Mapping Project. Should you desire more customized data, you can continue with the other options on the Data Dashboard to generate a custom data set.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Timeline<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Much of the data on the U.S. Cluster Mapping website is useful only in the context to a timeline where progress or change can be shown. As such, the next two options allow you to set the beginning and end points of the data set. Currently data is only available up through the year 2009.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Once you have determined whether you are looking for either a map view or a chart view, and have set the years you want for, it\\u2019s time to select different cluster filter options in the Dashboard, located on the left side of the frame. Any time you adjust these options you must select the \\u201cUpdate Map\\/Chart\\u201d button at the top left in order to display the new data settings.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Map View<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When selecting options for a map, the first selection you must make is to define the regions you are interested in exploring in order to build the relevant map and data information. The drop down will allow you to select from national, states, economic areas, or metropolitan statistical areas.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Once you\\u2019ve selected the region, you will then be adjusting the cluster data the map will show you.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>First you must select the type of cluster, whether traded, local, or natural endowment.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Second, you will be asked to select which cluster to focus on, followed by an option to select any specific sub-cluster to examine.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You can see additional information by selecting a data set to be imposed in bubbles, or for organizations to be imposed on the map.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Once you have made these selections, click the \\u201cUpdate Map\\u201d button to see the data displayed on the map.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Chart View<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When using the Data Dashboard to generate a chart, you will first select whether you want to focus on a cluster or a region.

Exporting will generate a comma separated values file (.csv) that can be opened in Excel. If you are logged in, you can also save the data generated in your analysis for review later.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You will also find options for sharing the data via social networks, email, or printing, utilizing the icons at the bottom right of the Data Dashboard.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Feedback<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Our charter is to make research, analysis and community connections within the U.S. Cluster Mapping site readily informative and actionable.
